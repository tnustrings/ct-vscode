# ct for vscode

codetext extension for vscode.

codetext lets you embed code in text like images or figures floating
in a document. it's a bit like jupyter notebooks with the addition
that code chunks are named and you can use the names to nest chunks.

for a codetext example, see [./try/foo.ct](`foo.ct`).

ct for vscode provides the following commands:

`ct: assemble (ctrl-alt-c)`: assemble code\
`ct: go to line (ctrl-alt-g)`: given a line from a generated file, go to its line in the source .ct file\
